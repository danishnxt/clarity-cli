"""Adopting a project that already has work in it.

Adopt ships a document, not an algorithm, so most of what could go wrong is in
the seams around it: does the file land, does the agent block point at it, does
deleting it actually end adoption, and does the procedure it describes still
match the commands the CLI offers.
