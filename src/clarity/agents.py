"""Telling other agents that this project uses clarity.

Every coding agent reads a markdown instructions file before it starts, and each
one reads a different file: Claude Code takes CLAUDE.md, Gemini takes GEMINI.md,
and most of the rest have settled on AGENTS.md. None of them are ours. A user's
CLAUDE.md is where they keep their own rules, and clarity has no business owning
that file.

So we write one marker-fenced block into it and leave every other byte alone:

    <!-- CLARITY:START -->
    ...
    <!-- CLARITY:END -->

Re-running finds the markers and swaps the body; nothing outside them is touched,
a byte-equal write reports `unchanged`, and `remove` takes the block back out.

There used to be a second file, .clarity/RULES.md, that this block pointed at.
It is gone. It was generated from config.yaml and the current objective, which
made it a cached copy of state that already lives in worklog.yaml — a second
place to keep in sync, and one that quietly fell behind its own generator. The
block below is a constant instead, so there is nothing to regenerate and nothing
to go stale. The objective is not in it: `clarity status` prints that, live.

AGENTS.md carries the block. CLAUDE.md carries a one-line import of AGENTS.md
rather than a copy, so there is exactly one body of text to read or change. The
import is not optional — Claude Code does not read AGENTS.md on its own.

## Why the block is short, and why it stays short

It is loaded on every turn, by every agent, in every session — including
subagents, which inherit the instructions file but not whatever the main agent
chose to read. So it carries the rules that are expensive to get wrong and the
loop you actually run, and nothing else. Adding to it costs every turn of every
session.

## Why the wording is conditional

A global install writes this into ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, which loads in every
project the user ever opens — nearly all of which have no worklog.yaml. An
unconditional "state lives in clarity" would send agents into failing commands
in projects that never adopted it. The block therefore states its own
precondition and tells the reader to ignore it when it does not hold.

  `clarity --help` — every command.
- `clarity q active --json`, `clarity q item <id> --json` — for you. Every read
  takes `--json` and answers `{ok, command, data, warnings, version}`.
- Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 error · 2 validation · 3 not a clarity project · 4 refused.
- Never hand-edit `worklog.yaml` or the generated block in `EPOCH.md` — both are
  rewritten from the commands. Below the marker in `EPOCH.md` is yours.
- Start work with `clarity epoch start <id>`; it takes an idea straight to active.
  Then work in that epoch's folder: `clarity path`.
- Claim before you work: `clarity claim <id>`, `clarity release <id>` when done.
  Pass the id every time — `clarity env` lasts only for the shell it ran in.
- Record what you tried as you go, not at the end: `clarity note "..."`. Those
  notes are what the next session reads."""
