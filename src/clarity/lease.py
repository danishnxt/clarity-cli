"""Leases: who is working an epoch.

A lease is one file per epoch (`EPOCHS/NNN_.../.lease`), claimed with O_EXCL so two
processes racing for the same epoch cannot both create it.

It is a warning, not a lock. Clarity has no way to stop a second agent editing the
worktree — git and the filesystem take writes from anyone — so it does not pretend
to. A lease says "someone is on this, here is who and since when", refuses a second
claim, and offers `--steal`. The repo belongs to whoever is running clarity; if they
decide to take it, that is their call to make, not ours to prevent.

Deliberately absent: expiry and process checks. Both were attempts to guess whether
the holder was still alive, and both guessed wrong — a pid recorded by a one-shot CLI
is dead the moment the command exits, which quietly made every lease takeable. Now
nothing expires on its own. A stale lease waits for a person, the way terraform's
state lock waits for `force-unlock`.

Machine-local state — gitignored, never part of the worklog.
